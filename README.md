# Child-Selector

 ## Child Selector in CSS:
The Child Selector in CSS is used to select elements that are direct children of a specified parent element. The parent element is selected using the basic selector, while the > symbol is used to target the direct children. This allows you to apply styles specifically to elements that are immediate children (and not nested deeper) of the specified parent. For example, in div > p, it selects all <p> elements that are direct children of a <div> element. This selector is useful for structuring pages and applying styles more precisely.


#### I created five images about the topic:
I created five images explaining the Child Selector in CSS. These images illustrate how the > selector works to target direct child elements and how to style them accordingly. The visuals show the relationship between parent and child elements within the HTML tree. Additionally, I provided practical examples of using the child selector to style text, colors, and dimensions on a webpage.
